The Process for Converting CIL Issues to ePub/Kindle

1. Layout
- Use custom styles in the Word template to lay out the document. 
- Check the document to make sure every element is styled. (Later we'll create a macro for this.)
- When you're *sure* every element is styled, save as PDF. *This is necessary to make sure the citation is correct; the official citation follows the PDF pagination.*
2. Epub conversion
- Import each Word document to Sigil, using the Word Import plugin; each one will be a separate file. (Add instructions here for attaching styles, images, etc. to individual documents)
- STILL TO DO: Figure out why the Sigil custom styles map isn't working.
- Clean up using Mend/Prettify.
- Use the Sigil template to add the title page and the masthead.
- Manually format the document in Sigil. (Add here: the various Sigil clips, shortcuts, regexes, etc.)
- Use the Canva template to create the cover image.
- Use the Sigil cover template to make a cover from the cover image.
- Run the validity/accessibility checker in Sigil.
- Save regularly and preview in an epub viewer (or more than one).
3. Kindle conversion
- Use Calibre or the Kindle Previewer to convert the epub to Kindle. 
4. HTML 
- It's already in valid XHTML at this point;
